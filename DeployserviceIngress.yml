Deploy Your Application: Deploy your application or services to Kubernetes. For example, let's deploy a simple web application represented by a Deployment and a corresponding Service:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
This example deploys an Nginx web server as a Deployment with three replicas and exposes it via a Service.

Define Ingress Resource: Now, define an Ingress resource to expose your service to external traffic. Below is an example of an Ingress resource definition:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: webapp-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: webapp
            port:
              number: 80
In this example:

host: Specifies the domain name for which the Ingress should route traffic.
http: Defines rules for HTTP traffic.
paths: Specifies the URL paths to match and how to route the traffic.
backend: Specifies the backend service to route traffic to.
Deploy Ingress Resource: Apply the Ingress resource definition to your Kubernetes cluster:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
This will create the Ingress resource named webapp-ingress.

Access Your Application: Once the Ingress controller processes the Ingress resource, it will configure itself to route incoming HTTP requests to the specified backend service (webapp in this case). You can now access your application using the specified domain name (example.com in this example).
